     * Technically this will work...
     *
     * String name = new Object(){}.getClass().getEnclosingMethod().getName();
     * However, a new anonymous inner class will be created during compile time
     * (e.g. YourClass$1.class). So this will create a .class file for each method that deploys this trick.
     * Additionally, an otherwise unused object instance is created on each invocation during runtime.
     * So this may be an acceptable debug trick, but it does come with significant overhead.
     *
     * An advantage of this trick is that getEnclosingMethod() returns java.lang.reflect.Method which can
     * be used to retrieve all other information of the method including annotations and parameter names.
     * This makes it possible to distinguish between specific methods with the same name (method overload).
     *
     * Note that according to the JavaDoc of getEnclosingMethod() this trick should not throw a SecurityException
     * as inner classes should be loaded using the same class loader.
     * So there is no need to check the access conditions even if a security manager is present.
     *
     * Please be aware: It is required to use getEnclosingConstructor() for constructors.
     * During blocks outside of (named) methods, getEnclosingMethod() returns null
